# Strapi Removal Summary

## Overview

Strapi CMS has been completely removed from the Perry Chick project. Content management is now handled directly through the frontend application, providing a more streamlined architecture.

## Changes Made

### 1. Files and Directories Removed

- **`/strapi/`** - Entire Strapi directory and all contents
- **`scripts/setup-strapi.ps1`** - Strapi setup script
- **`scripts/generate-strapi-secrets.ps1`** - Strapi secrets generation script

### 2. Configuration Updates

#### Environment Variables (`.env.local`)

- Removed all Strapi-related environment variables:
  - `STRAPI_URL`
  - `STRAPI_API_TOKEN`
  - `STRAPI_JWT_SECRET`
  - `STRAPI_ADMIN_JWT_SECRET`
  - `STRAPI_APP_KEYS`
  - `STRAPI_API_TOKEN_SALT`

#### Kubernetes Deployment (`k8s/deploy.yaml`)

- Removed Strapi deployment and service definitions
- Eliminated Strapi container configuration
- Removed Strapi environment variables from secrets

#### Scripts Updated

- **`build-images.ps1`**: Removed Strapi Docker image building
- **`deploy-full.ps1`**: Removed Strapi from deployment restart commands
- **`forward-all-services.ps1`**: Removed Strapi port forwarding (1337)
- **`generate-secrets.ps1`**: Removed Strapi secret keys
- **`update-env-config.ps1`**: Removed Strapi sensitive variables

### 3. Development Environment

#### VS Code Tasks (`.vscode/tasks.json`)

- Removed "Debug Strapi" task
- Removed "Setup Strapi" task
- Removed "Generate Strapi Secrets" task

#### Workspace Configuration (`perry-chick.code-workspace`)

- Removed Strapi folder from workspace

### 4. Documentation Updates

#### README.md

- Updated overview to reflect frontend-managed content
- Removed Strapi from tech stack
- Updated feature descriptions to mention frontend admin interface
- Emphasized that content management is now handled through the frontend

## Architecture Changes

### Before (With Strapi)

```
Frontend (SvelteKit) ← API calls → Strapi CMS ← Database → PostgreSQL
                     ← API calls → Backend (C# API) ← Database → PostgreSQL
```

### After (Frontend-Managed)

```
Frontend (SvelteKit) ← API calls → Backend (C# API) ← Database → PostgreSQL
    ↳ Admin Interface for content management
```

## Benefits of Removal

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Fewer moving parts and services to manage
2. **Reduced Resource Usage**: No need for Strapi container and its dependencies
3. **Unified Management**: All content management through the main frontend application
4. **Easier Development**: One less service to run and maintain locally
5. **Better Integration**: Direct database access through the existing backend API

## Migration Path for Content Management

The frontend application should now include:

1. **Admin Interface**: Protected admin routes for content management
2. **Product Management**: CRUD operations for store items
3. **Content Pages**: Management of static content and pages
4. **User Management**: Admin functions for user administration
5. **Order Management**: Interface for viewing and managing orders

## Services Still Available

After removing Strapi, the following services remain available:

### Core Services

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5006
- **Notifications**: http://localhost:5003

### Infrastructure

- **Keycloak**: http://localhost:8080 (Authentication)
- **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5432 (Database)
- **Redis**: localhost:6379 (Cache/Queue)

### Monitoring

- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3001 (Dashboards)
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090 (Metrics)
- **Jaeger**: http://localhost:16686 (Tracing)

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Admin Interface**: Create admin routes in the frontend for content management
2. **Update API Endpoints**: Ensure the backend has all necessary endpoints for content management
3. **User Role Management**: Implement proper admin role checking in the frontend
4. **Content Migration**: If there was existing Strapi content, it should be migrated to the new system
5. **Update Documentation**: Update any API documentation to reflect the new content management approach

## Verification

To verify the removal was successful:

1. **Check Services**: Run `./scripts/forward-all-services.ps1` - should not include Strapi
2. **Build Images**: Run `./scripts/build-images.ps1` - should not attempt to build Strapi
3. **Deploy**: Run `./scripts/deploy-full.ps1` - should deploy without Strapi
4. **Environment**: Check `.env.local` has no Strapi references
5. **Kubernetes**: Verify `k8s/deploy.yaml` has no Strapi deployment

The Perry Chick project is now a more streamlined e-commerce platform with content management handled directly through the frontend application.
